## Speaking Calculator

#### Project Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a speaking calculator which is mainly helpful for the physically challenged people.

#### Project Description:
A Speaking Calculator accepts input from keyboard and also as voice. Once the input is entered it will ask user to confirm whether the entered details are correct or
wrong. Once user confirms, based on the input it performs the mathematical operations. Mathematical expression along with result is spoken out. Planning to use Java
for backend and use public libraries for voice assisstance. Later will try to develop an IOS application on the same.
#### Project Details:
We are going to develop a web application using the public library Web Speech API.
#### Client:
Dr. ChandraMouli Kotteti<br>
Assistant Professor, School of Computer Science<br>
Northwest Missouri State University

#### Team Members:
Naina Sahiri<br>
Madhupriya Gundeti<br>
Anjana Thanguturi<br>
Srujan Kumar Reddy Yeruva<br>
Sindhuja Vilipala<br>

#### Team Goals:
- To complete the sprint tasks on time.
- To participate in every team meeting and every individual should share there updates.
- To communicate and collaborate effectively within the team.
- To make the client satisfy with the deliverable.
